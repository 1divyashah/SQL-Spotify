 SQL Database and Query Development

- **Database Creation and Schema Design**: Designed and implemented a relational database schema for a music streaming application, including tables for users, playlists, tracks, and playlist-track relationships. Defined primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints to maintain data integrity.

- **Data Insertion**: Successfully populated the database with sample data, including users, playlists, tracks, and playlist-track associations, ensuring a diverse dataset for querying.

- **SQL Query Development**: Developed and optimized SQL queries to address various business requirements, including:
  - **Data Retrieval**: Extracted distinct album names, artist details, user registrations, and track information based on various criteria such as registration dates and track durations.
  - **Aggregations and Calculations**: Performed aggregations to count playlists per user, average track durations, and total durations for playlists.
  - **Advanced Queries**: Implemented complex queries involving subqueries, joins, and aggregate functions to identify users creating playlists with specific track criteria, determine top users based on average track duration, and rank tracks within albums.

- **Performance Optimization**: Utilized indexing and optimized query structures to enhance performance and ensure efficient data retrieval and manipulation.
